# Jutsu - A anime api made with GoLang
Jutsu is a GoLang API for [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net). It scrapes the website to satisfy the need for API functionality that MyAnimeList.net lacks.

Jutsu's main goal is to help developers to easily access the data needed for their apps and projects, without having any kind of tracking or request limit or unstable API's issues.

The word _Jutsu_ literally translates to _Art_ in Japanese (**è¡“**). And that's what this API is. ;)

A shoutout to their amazing products and for supporting Jutsu since early versions!
